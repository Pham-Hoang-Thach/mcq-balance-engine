# MCQ Balance Engine

The **MCQ Balance Engine** is an Emacs Lisp tool designed to facilitate the creation of randomized, balanced, and non-repeating sets of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) within Org-mode files. It supports tag-based filtering, persistent uniqueness across sessions, and seamless export of questions and answers for exams, quizzes, or productivity templates.

# Features

- üåÄ **Fisher‚ÄìYates shuffle**: Fairly randomizes selection of Org subtrees.
- üîñ **Tag-based filtering**: Selects only top-level parent or leaf nodes with tags.
- üìä **Tag summary buffer**: Shows a real-time count of how many items are available per tag.
- üéØ **User-defined tag input**: Choose how many questions per tag to include.
- üß† **Persistent uniqueness**: Guarantees previously seen combinations won't repeat across sessions.
- üÜî **Random 3-digit exam code**: Each combo is given a unique ID stored on disk.
- üì§ **Export cleaned buffer**: Removes metadata, renumbers questions, and optionally shows tags.
- üì• **Extract correct answers**: Outputs answers into a CSV file from Org `:Correct:` properties.
- üîç **Check missing correct answers**: Identify questions missing the `:Correct:` property in your Org-mode files. It displays clickable links to those questions, making it easy to fix them.


# Installation

To use the MCQ Balance Engine, simply download the following files:

1. `mcq-persistent-org-combo-shuffler.el`
2. `mcq-extract-correct-answers.el`
3. `mcq-export-cleaned-questions.el`
4. `mcq-check-missing-correct-answers.el`

Place them in your Emacs `load-path` directory and load them into your Emacs environment.

```emacs-lisp
(load-file "/path/to/mcq-persistent-org-combo-shuffler.el")
(load-file "/path/to/mcq-extract-correct-answers.el")
(load-file "/path/to/mcq-export-cleaned-questions.el")
(load-file "/path/to/mcq-check-missing-correct-answers.el")
```

Alternatively, you can copy the contents of these files into your Emacs configuration file.

# Usage

## Persistent Org Combo Shuffler

To start shuffling and selecting unique combinations of Org-mode headings by tags:

1. Open your Org-mode file in Emacs.
2. Run the command: `M-x mcq-persistent-org-combo-shuffler`
3. The engine will display a summary of available tags and their counts.
4. Enter your tag specifications (e.g., `math=2,science=3`).
5. The engine will generate a unique combination of headings, ensuring that no combination repeats.

## Extract Correct Answers

To extract the correct answers and save them as a CSV:

1. Open your Org-mode file containing questions and answers.
2. Run the command: `M-x mcq-extract-correct-answers`
3. You will be prompted to enter a file path where the answers will be saved.
4. The answers will be extracted and saved in a CSV format with the structure: `Question, Answer`.

## Export Cleaned Questions

1. From the shuffled buffer, run the command: `M-x mcq-export-cleaned-questions`
2. Renumbers all questions sequentially (`Question 1`, `Question 2`, etc. or `C√¢u 1`, `C√¢u 2`, ... if in Vietnamese).
3. Removes all `:PROPERTIES:` drawers.
4. Optionally includes tags inline.
5. Preserves `Exam code: 3-digit number` heading at the top.

## Check Missing Correct Answers

1. Open your Org-mode file.
2. Run `M-x mcq-check-missing-correct-answers`.
3. A buffer will open showing links to questions missing the `:Correct:` value.

# Customization

The **MCQ Balance Engine** stores previously used combinations and IDs to ensure that no combination is repeated.

You can configure the maximum number of attempts to generate a unique combination by modifying the `max-attempts` variable in the code.

# File Structure

- `mcq-persistent-org-combo-shuffler.el`: Contains functions for shuffling and displaying MCQ combinations.
- `mcq-extract-correct-answers.el`: Extracts correct answers marked by `:Correct:` and saves them to a CSV.
- `mcq-export-cleaned-questions.el`: Exports shuffled MCQ questions into a clean Org buffer.
- `mcq-check-missing-correct-answers.el`: Scans MCQ entries and detects if any questions are missing a correct answer.
- `-unique-combinations.el`: A file storing previously generated combinations for the associated Org file.
- `.used-ids.el`: A file storing the used 3-digit IDs for the associated Org file.

# Notes

- Combinations are normalized by heading content for accurate comparison.

- Intermediate child nodes (with children) are excluded from tag summary.

# Tested Environment

- Debian 12 / WSL2: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

- Emacs: 30.1

- Orgmode: 9.7.11
