# MCQ Balance Engine

The **MCQ Balance Engine** is an Emacs-based tool designed to shuffle multiple-choice question (MCQ) headings in Org-mode files, ensuring unique combinations of questions based on specified tags. It also extracts correct answers from Org-mode files and saves them as a CSV file for easy access and analysis.

# Features

- **Randomized Shuffling**: Uses the Fisher-Yates algorithm to shuffle question headings randomly.
- **Persistent Uniqueness**: Ensures that combinations of questions, selected by tags, remain unique across sessions.
- **Tag-Based Organization**: Supports organizing questions by tags, making it easy to select subsets of questions based on user input.
- **Customizable Output**: Allows you to specify whether tags should be displayed in the output.
- **Correct Answer Extraction**: Automatically extracts `:Correct:` tagged answers from Org-mode files and saves them as a CSV.

# Installation

To use the MCQ Balance Engine, simply download the following files:

1. `persistent-org-combo-shuffler.el`
2. `extract-correct-answers.el`

Place them in your Emacs `load-path` directory and load them into your Emacs environment.

```emacs-lisp
(load-file "/path/to/persistent-org-combo-shuffler.el")
(load-file "/path/to/extract-correct-answers.el")
```

Alternatively, you can copy the contents of these files into your Emacs configuration file.

# Usage

## Persistent Org Combo Shuffler

To start shuffling and selecting unique combinations of Org-mode headings by tags:

1. Open your Org-mode file in Emacs.
2. Run the command: `M-x persistent-org-combo-shuffler`
3. The engine will display a summary of available tags and their counts.
4. Enter your tag specifications (e.g., `math=2,science=3`).
5. The engine will generate a unique combination of headings, ensuring that no combination repeats.
6. You can choose whether to include tags in the output.

## Extract Correct Answers

To extract the correct answers and save them as a CSV:

1. Open your Org-mode file containing questions and answers.
2. Run the command: `M-x extract-correct-answers`
3. You will be prompted to enter a file path where the answers will be saved.
4. The answers will be extracted and saved in a CSV format with the structure: `Question, Answer`.

## Example

After running the `persistent-org-combo-shuffler` function, you may get a result like the following in a new buffer:

```org
* Exam code: 123

** Math: What is 2 + 2?
- Answer: 4

** Science: What is the boiling point of water?
- Answer: 100Â°C
```

# Customization

The **MCQ Balance Engine** stores previously used combinations and IDs to ensure that no combination is repeated.

You can configure the maximum number of attempts to generate a unique combination by modifying the `max-attempts` variable in the code.

# File Structure

- `persistent-org-combo-shuffler.el`: Contains functions for shuffling and displaying MCQ combinations.
- `extract-correct-answers.el`: Extracts correct answers marked by `:Correct:` and saves them to a CSV.
- `-unique-combinations.el`: A file storing previously generated combinations for the associated Org file.
- `.used-ids.el`: A file storing the used 3-digit IDs for the associated Org file.
